       At FoodConnect, we aim to bridge the gap between surplus and scarcity. Our platform connects restaurants, cafes, and food donors with NGOs and shelters to ensure that excess food reaches those who need it most—fresh, safe, and on time.

Through our real-time map feature, donors can easily locate nearby NGOs, while organizations can track available food sources in their vicinity. This transparent and tech-driven approach not only reduces food waste but also fosters a more sustainable and compassionate community.

We believe in the power of connection—between people, places, and purposes. By turning technology into a tool for social good, FoodConnect is helping build a world where no meal goes to waste and every act of giving makes a difference.
